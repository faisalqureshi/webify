# Webify

A python static site generator using information stored in yaml files.  It is
designed to process: html, markdown, and jupyter notebook files.  It can be
used to generate an entire site or perform markdown to html/LaTeX/Beamer conversion.  Check [here](http://vclab.science.uoit.ca/webify-manual/introduction.html) for more information.

[My website](http://faculty.uoit.ca/qureshi) is generated using this utility.  Most of my course websites are
also generated using this tool.
