# Webify

A python static site generator using information stored in yaml files.  It is
designed to process: html, markdown, and jupyter notebook files.  It can be
used to generate an entire site or perform markdown to html/LaTeX/Beamer conversion.
It also supports templating through mustache and jinja2.

[My website](http://faculty.uoit.ca/qureshi) is generated using this utility.  Most of my course websites are
also generated using this webify.
